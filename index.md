## Profile

Max is a software developer with a broad range of interests and
skills. He recently graduated with a MSc degree in Computer and
Information Engineering from Uppsala University.

Although he is especially interested in the functional programming
paradigm and has experience with a range of functional languages such
as Erlang, Haskell, and Lisp, he is also well versed in object
oriented languages
such as C++, Dart and Java. He is also fluent in Rust.  

For his Master’s Thesis, Max worked with an extension for the
constraint modelling language MiniZinc, and during his time as a
systems programmer at SAAB he wrote performance critical C++ code
while also maintaining his team’s CI pipeline. At Happi Hacking he has
developed
a cross platform mobile game application in Flutter.  

Max is a fast learner and has the important sense of quality, while at
the same time being able to deliver as needed, when needed. He’s good
at structuring his own work and keeping the pace. Meanwhile, he takes
responsibility for the whole team’s results and is an appreciated team
member.
